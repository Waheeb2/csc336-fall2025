## My App

My app is a **Travel Planner** called **TravelBook**, designed to help people organize and keep track of their trips.  
It allows users to:

- Add trips with a title, country, city, travel dates, notes, and an optional image.  
- View all trips in a searchable list.  
- Click any trip to see detailed information on its own page.  
- Edit or delete existing trips.  

Overall, the app functions like a **personal travel diary**, keeping all future plans or past memories in one place.

## Libraries Used

### React Libraries:
- **react-router-dom**
- **react-toastify**

### Backend / Node Libraries:
- **Express**
- **CORS**


## What I Would Like You to Know:
- I implemented **form validation**, including checking for empty fields, invalid dates, and validating image URLs.  
- The app lets people **create, read, update, and delete trips**.  
- I also added **search filtering** by title, city, or country, making it easier to find trips.  
- Users can add images to their trips.  
- I added **Toast notifications** for better user experience.

Overall, I had fun doing this project!
