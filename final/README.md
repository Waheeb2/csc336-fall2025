# Waheeb's FInal!

My app is a Travel Planner called TravelBook, designed to help people organize and keep track of their trips. It allows users to:
Add trips with a title, country, city, travel dates, notes, and an optional image.
View all trips in a clean, searchable list.
Click any trip to see detailed information on its own page.
Edit or delete existing trips.
Overall, the app functions like a personal travel diary, keeping all future plans or past memories in one place.

I used the following libraries in the project:

React Libraries:
react-router-dom 
react-toastify

Backend/Node Libraries:
Express
CORS

What I would like you to know:
I implemented form validation, including checking for empty fields, invalid dates, and validating image URLs.
The app lets people sers can create, read, update, and delete trips.
I also added search filtering by title, city, or country, made it to where 
users can images to their tripsToast notifications for better user.

Overall, I had fun doing this project!
